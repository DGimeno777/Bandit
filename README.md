# Bandit
Tool to gather agency roster lists and compare artist popularity statistics

## Scraping 
This project uses lxml web scraping in python to collect the names of artists on agency rosters

## Spotipy
This project uses Spotipy to retrieve artist popularity data to sort and filter artists

## Other Plans
I am also planning to use facebook to get likes of artists and google trends to get graphs and search information on artists

# Setup (for future)
1. Install the latest version of Python (https://www.python.org/)
2. In terminal, run 'pip install sys' (you may not have to do this), 'pip install spotipy', 'pip install lxml'
3. Setup Spotipy env vars to connect to spotify api
   - SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID      = Spotify API Client_ID
   - SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET  = Spotify API Client_Secret
   - SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI   = http://localhost:8888/callback
4. Copy this repo to your machine or download as a zip and unzip
5. Using Python Idle (installed in step 1), open the 'main.py' file from the downloaded Bandit project and run the module.
6. Bandit should now be running (to the extent that it can).

# Workflows
Coming soon...
