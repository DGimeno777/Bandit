# Bandit
Tool to gather agency roster lists and compare artist popularity statistics

## Scraping 
This project uses lxml web scraping in python to collect the names of artists on agency rosters

## Spotipy
This project will use Spotipy to retrieve artist popularity data from Spotify

## Other Plans
I am also planning to use facebook to get likes of artists and google trends to get graphs and search information on the artists
